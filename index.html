<h1>ALYSSA SHEA</h1>

<p> Driven by a compulsion to create, bound by nothing but my own comfort and confidence, I'm working towards equipping myself with the technical skills and theoretical training that will empower me to move beyond my current career path. <br><br> With a BA in Film Studies and Italian, I've worked a variety of jobs over the last 8 years, oscillating between capitalizing on my creative talents and reserving them for personal, non-monetary satisfaction. My passions and strengths lie in video production and drumming, with my more informal pursuits being graphic, product, web, and lighting design. <br><br> Forever thinking, forever tinkering -- this is the collection of my crafts. </p>
